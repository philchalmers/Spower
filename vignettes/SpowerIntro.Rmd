This vignette provides a brief introduction to using the package `Spower` for prospective/post-hoc, a priori, sensitivity, criterion, and compromise power analyses. For a more detailed description of the package refer to associated publication (Chalmers, in press) as well as the documentation found within the functions, particularly `Spower()`, `SpowerBatch()`, and `SpowerCurve()`.

# Types of functions

There are generally two-ways to go about using `Spower`; either by utilizing a handful of build-in simulation experiments with an associated analysis, or by constructing the simulation experiment yourself. In either case, the goal is to manipulate R code to perform a single simulation experiment and have the function return a suitable $p$-value under the null hypothesis, or a logical value also reflecting the complement of the null hypothesis of interest. More than one $p$-value/`logical` value may of course be returned by the functions, however for simplicity this vignette will focus on simple single-valued functions.

## Built-in experiements

`Spower` ships with several common experiment structures, such as those involving linear regression models, mediation, ANOVAs, $t$-tests, and so on. The simulation experiments are organized with the prefix `p_`, followed by the name of the analysis method. For instance, 

```{r}
p_lm.R2(50, k=3, R2=.3)
```
performs a single simulation experiment reflecting the null hypothesis $H_0:\, R^2=0$ for a linear regression model with $k=3$ predictor variables and a sample size of $N=50$. Translating this into a power-analysis  simply requires passing this experiment in some form to `Spower()` (the details of which are discussed below), where in this case the estimate of power ($1-\beta$) is returned.

```{r eval=eval}
p_lm.R2(50, k=3, R2=.3) |> Spower() 
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(eval) store$R2ex <- getLastSpower()
print(store$R2ex)
```

Each of these functions return a $p$-value as this is the general information required to evaluate statistical power with `Spower()`. Alternatively, users may define their own simulation functions if the desired experiment has not been defined within the package.

Note that further information is stored in these objects as well, which can be coerced using `dplyr::as_tibble()` or further inspected via `summary()` for more detailed output.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# get last estimated result from Spower()
last <- getLastSpower()
dplyr::as_tibble(last)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
last <- store$R2ex
dplyr::as_tibble(last)
```

## User-defined functions

As a very simple example, suppose one were interested in the power to reject the null hypothesis $H_0:\, \mu = \mu_0$ in a one-sample $t$-test scenario. While the package already supports this (see `help(p_t.test)`) users may write their own version of this experiment, one instance of which may look like the following.

```{r}
p_single.t <- function(n, mean, mu=0){
	g <- rnorm(n, mean=mean)
	p <- t.test(g, mu=mu)$p.value
	p
}
```

Using the defaults of this defined function evaluates whether a sample of data drawn from a Gaussian distribution with some specific `mean` ($\mu$) differs from the value of $mu = 0$ ($\mu_0$). Hence, the $p$-value returned from this experiments reflects the null hypothesis $H_0:\, \mu=\mu_0$, or more specifically $H_0:\, \mu=0$, for a single generated dataset.

```{r}
# a single experiment
p_single.t(n=100, mean=.2)
```

# Types of power analyses to evaluate

For power analyses there are typically four parameters that are/can be manipulated or solved in a given experiment: the $\alpha$ level (Type I error, often reflexively set to $\alpha=.05$), power (the complement of the Type II error, $1-\beta$), an effect size of interest, and the sample size. Given three of these values, the fourth can always be solved. Note that this description reflects a rule-of-thumb as there may be multiple effect sizes of interest, multiple sample sizes (e.g., in the form of cluster sizes in multi-level models), and so on. In `Spower()` switching between these types of power analysis criteria is done simply by explicitly specifying which parameter is missing (`NA`), as demonstrated below.

## Prospective/post-hoc power analysis

The canonical setup for `Spower()` will evaluate prospective or post-hoc power, thereby obtaining the estimate $1-\hat{\beta}$. Default in `Spower()` uses $10,000$ independent simulation `replications`. The following provides an estimate of power given the null hypothesis $H_0:\, \mu=0.3$.

```{r eval=eval}
p_single.t(n=100, mean=.5, mu=.3) |> Spower() -> prospective
prospective
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(eval) store$prospective <- prospective
prospective <- store$prospective
print(prospective)
```

## Compromise power analysis

Compromise power analysis involves manipulating the $\alpha$ level until some sufficient balance between the Type I and Type II error rates are met, expressed in terms of the ratio $q=\frac{\beta}{\alpha}$. 

In `Spower`, there are two ways to approach this criterion. The first way, which focuses on the `beta_alpha` ratio at the outset, simply requires passing the target ratio to `Spower()` using the same setup as the previous prospective power analysis. 

```{r eval=eval}
p_single.t(n=100, mean=.5, mu=.3) |> 
	Spower(beta_alpha=4) -> compromise
compromise
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(eval) store$compromise <- getLastSpower()
compromise <- store$compromise
print(compromise)
```

This returns the estimated `sig.level` ($\hat{\alpha}$) and resulting $\hat{\beta}$ that satisfies the target $q$ ratio.

```{r}
# satisfies q = 4 ratio
with(compromise, (1 - power) / sig.level)
```


The second way to perform a compromise analysis is to re-use a previous evaluation of a prospective power analysis as this contains all the necessary information. 

```{r}
# using previous post-hoc/prospective power analysis
update(prospective, beta_alpha=4)
```

In either case, the use of `update()` can be beneficial as the stored result can be reused with alternative `beta_alpha` values without having to generate and analyse new experimental data. 


## A priori power analysis

The goal of a priori power analysis is generally to obtain the sample size ($N$) associated with a specific power rate of interest (e.g., $1-\beta=.90$), which is useful in the context of future data collection. 

To estimate the sample size using Monte Carlo simulation experiments, `Spower()` performs stochastic root solving using the ProBABLI approach from the `SimDesign` package, and requires a specific search `interval` to search within. The width of the interval should reflect a plausible range where the researcher believes the solution to lie, however this may be quite large as well as ProBABLI is less influenced by the range of the interval (Chalmers, 2024). 

Below the sample size `n` is solved to achieve a target power of $1-\beta=.80$, where the solution was suspected to lie somewhere between the search `interval = c(20, 200)`.

```{r eval=eval}
p_single.t(n=NA, mean=.5) |> 
	Spower(power=.8, interval=c(20,200))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(eval) store$apriori <- getLastSpower()
print(store$apriori)
```


## Sensitivity power analysis

Similar to a priori power analysis, however the goal is now to find some specific standardized or unstandardized effect size associated with a specific power rate. This pertains to the question of how large an effect size must be in order to reliably detect the effect of interest. 

Below the sample size is fixed at $N=100$, while the search interval for the standardized effect size $d$ is searched between the `interval = c(.1, 3)`. Note that the use of decimals in the interval tells `Spower()` to use a continuous rather than discrete search space (cf. with a priori, which uses an integer search space for the simulation replicates).

```{r eval=eval}
p_single.t(n=100, mean=NA) |> 
	Spower(power=.8, interval=c(.1, 3))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(eval) store$sensitive <- getLastSpower()
print(store$sensitive)
```

## Criterion power analysis

Finally, in criterion power analysis the goal is to located the associated $\alpha$ level (`sig.level`) require to achieve a target power output holding constant the other modeling information. This is done in `Spower()` by setting the `sig.level` input to `NA` while providing values for the other parameters. Note that no search interval is require in this context as $\alpha$ necessarily lies between the interval $[0,1]$.

```{r eval=eval}
p_single.t(n=50, mean=.5) |> 
	Spower(power=.8, sig.level=NA)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(eval) store$criterion <- getLastSpower()
print(store$criterion)
```

# Multiple power evaluation functions 

The following functions, `SpowerBatch()` and `SpowerCurve()`, can be used to evaluate and visualize power analysis results across a range on inputs rather than for a single set of fixed inputs. This section demonstrate their general usage as the specifications slightly differ from that of `Spower()`, despite the fact that `Spower()` is the underlying estimation engine.


## SpowerBatch()

To begin, suppose that there was interest in evaluating the `p_single.t()` function across multiple $n$ inputs to obtain estimates of $1-\beta$. While this could be performed using independent calls to `Spower()`, the function `SpowerBatch()` can instead be used, where the variable inputs can be specified in vector format. For instance, given the effect size $\mu=.5$, what would be the power to reject the null hypothesis $H_0:\, \mu=0$ across three different sample sizes. 

```{r eval=eval}
p_single.t(mean=.5) |> 
	SpowerBatch(n=c(30, 60, 90)) -> prospective.batch
prospective.batch
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(eval) store$prospective.batch <- prospective.batch
prospective.batch <- store$prospective.batch
print(prospective.batch)
```
This can further be coerced to a `data.frame` object if there is reason to do so (e.g., for plotting purpose).

```{r}
as.data.frame(prospective.batch)
```

Similarly, if the were related to a priori analyses for sample size planning then the inputs to `SpowerBatch()` would be modified to set `n` to the missing quantity.

```{r eval=eval}
apriori.batch <- p_single.t(mean=.5, n=NA) |> 
	SpowerBatch(power=c(.7, .8, .9), interval=c(20, 200)) 
apriori.batch
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(eval) store$apriori.batch <- apriori.batch
apriori.batch <- store$apriori.batch
print(apriori.batch)
```

```{r}
as.data.frame(apriori.batch)
```


## SpowerCurve()

Often times researchers wish to visualize the results of power analyses in the form of graphical representations. `Spower` supports various types of visualizations through the function `SpowerCurve()`, which creates power curve plots of previously obtained results (e.g., via `SpowerBatch()`) or for to-be-explored inputs. Importantly, each graphic contains estimates of the Monte Carlo sampling uncertainty to deter  over-interpretation of any resulting point-estimates.

To demonstrate, suppose one were interested in visualizing the power for the running single-sample $t$ test across four different sample sizes, $N=[30,60,90,120]$. To do this requires passing the simulation experiment and varying information to the function `SpowerCurve()`, which fills in the variable information to the supplied simulation experiment and plots the resulting output.

```{r eval=FALSE}
p_single.t(mean=.5) |> 
	SpowerCurve(n=c(30, 60, 90, 120))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(eval)
	store$gg1 <- p_single.t(mean=.5) |> SpowerCurve(n=c(30, 60, 90, 120))
print(store$gg1)
```

Alternatively, were the above information already evaluated using `SpowerBatch()` then this `batch` object could be passed directly to `SpowerCurve()`, thereby avoiding the need to re-evaluate the simulation experiments. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# pass previous SpowerBatch() object
SpowerCurve(batch=batch)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(eval) 
	SpowerCurve(batch=store$prospective.batch)	
```

`SpowerCurve()` will accept as many arguments as exists in the supplied simulation experiment definition, however it will only plot the first three variable input specifications as anything past this becomes more difficult to display automatically. Below is an example that varies both the `n` input as well as the input `mean`, where the first input appears on the $x$-axis while the second is mapped to the default colour aesthetic in `ggplot2`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
p_single.t() |> 
	SpowerCurve(n=c(30, 60, 90, 120), mean=c(.2, .5, .8))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(eval)
	store$gg2 <- p_single.t() |> 
		SpowerCurve(n=c(30, 60, 90, 120), mean=c(.2, .5, .8))
print(store$gg2)
```

```{r include=FALSE, eval=eval}
saveRDS(store, 'intro.rds') # move this when done
```
