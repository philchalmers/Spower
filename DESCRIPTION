Description: Provides a general purpose simulation-based power analysis 
   API for routine and customized simulation experimental designs. 
   The package focuses exclusively on Monte Carlo simulation experiment variants of 
   (expected) prospective power analyses, 
   criterion analyses, compromise analyses, sensitivity analyses, and 
   a priori/post-hoc analyses. The default simulation experiment functions defined within the package 
   provide stochastic variants of the power analysis subroutines in 
   G*Power 3.1 (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, and Lang, 2009) <doi:10.3758/brm.41.4.1149>,
   along with various other parametric and non-parametric power analysis 
   applications (e.g., mediation analyses) and support for Bayesian power analysis 
   by way of Bayes factors or posterior probability evaluations. 
   Additional functions for building 
   empirical power curves, reanalyzing simulation information, and 
   for increasing the precision of the resulting power 
   estimates are also included, each of which utilize similar API structures.
