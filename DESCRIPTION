Description: Provides a general purpose simulation-based power analysis 
   API for routine and customizable simulation experiment designs. 
   Supports Monte Carlo simulation variants of (expected) a priori power analysis, 
   criterion power analysis, compromise power analysis, sensitivity analysis, and post-hoc
   power analysis. Default generator functions found within the package 
   provide stochastic variants of the power analyses found in the 
   G*Power software (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, and Lang, 2009) <doi:10.3758/brm.41.4.1149>, 
   along with various other power analysis examples (e.g., mediation analyses), 
   as well as the ability to write user-defined simulation functions and 
   prior distributions for greater flexibility.
