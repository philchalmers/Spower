Description: This package provides a general purpose simulation-based power analysis 
   API for routine and customized simulation experimental designs. 
   The package focuses exclusively on Monte Carlo simulation variants of 
   (expected) prospective power analyses, 
   criterion power analyses, compromise power analyses, sensitivity analyses, and prospective/post-hoc
   power analyses. The default simulation experiement functions found within the package 
   provide stochastic variants of the power analyses subroutines found in the 
   G*Power 3 software (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, and Lang, 2009) <doi:10.3758/brm.41.4.1149>,
   along with various other power analysis examples (e.g., mediation analyses). Supporting
   functions are also included, such as for building empirical power curve estimates,
   which utilize a similar API structure.
