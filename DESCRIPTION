Description: Provides a general purpose simulation-based power analysis 
   API for routine and customized simulation experimental designs. 
   The package focuses exclusively on Monte Carlo simulation variants of 
   (expected) prospective power analyses, 
   criterion analyses, compromise analyses, sensitivity analyses, and 
   a priori/post-hoc analyses. The default simulation experiment functions found within the package 
   provide stochastic variants of the power analysis subroutines found in the 
   G*Power 3.1 software (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, and Lang, 2009) <doi:10.3758/brm.41.4.1149>,
   along with various other parametric and non-parametric power analysis 
   applications (e.g., mediation analyses). Additional functions for building 
   empirical power curve estimates are reanalyzing simulation information where 
   relavent are also included, which utilize similar API structures.
