Description: Provides general purpose simulation-based power analysis 
   functionality for routine and customizable designs. 
   Supports Monte Carlo simulation variants of a priori power analysis, 
   criterion power analysis, compromise power analysis, and post-hoc
   power analysis. Default generator functions provide stochastic variants
   of the power analyses found in the G*Power software (Faul, Erdfelder, 
   Buchner, and Lang, 2009) <10.3758/brm.41.4.1149>, various other 
   power analyses (e.g., mediation analyses), and the ability to write 
   user-defined simulation functions for complete customizability.
