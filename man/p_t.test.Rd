\title{Independent samples t-test simulation and p-value}
\usage{
p_t.test(n, d)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{sample size per group, assumed equal across groups}

\item{d}{Cohen's standardized effect size}
}
\value{
a single p-value
}
\description{
Function generates two sets of individuals with equal sample sizes
and Cohen's effect size 'd'. The data and associated t-test
assume that the conditional observations are normally distributed and have
have equal variance.
}
\examples{

# sample size of 50 per group, medium effect size
p_t.test(n=50, d=0.5)

}
